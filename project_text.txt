Methodology
Stage 1: User Interaction & Input Processing
Objective:Build a front-end to capture farmer queries (text, voice, image).
Implementation Steps
1 Develop the Mobile Application Interface
App Development: Use Flutter/React Native for Android & iOS.
UI/UX: Simple interface with large “Text,” “Voice,” “Photo” icons in
Malayalam.
2 Integrate the Voice Input Module (Speech-to-Text)
Service: Integrate a powerful Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
service with strong support for Malayalam (e.g., Google’s
Speech-to-Text API or OpenAI’s Whisper).
3 Implement the Image Input Module (Computer Vision)
Service: Integrate a CV model—start with a pre-trained plant disease
model, then train a custom one for local crops and pests.
4 Handle Direct Text Input
Process: Capture Malayalam/English text via input field and send to
backend for processing.

Methodology
Stage 2: Data Processing & Context Aggregation
Objective: Add personalized and real-time context to farmer queries.
Implementation Steps
1 Retrieve Farmer Profile & Historical Data
Fetch user details (location, crops, past queries) from PostgreSQL via
user ID.
2 Integrate External Data APIs
Weather Data: Integrate weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap/IMD)
for real-time local weather conditions.
Agronomic Data: Build an internal API to provide region- and
date-based crop season info.
3 Construct the Enriched Prompt
Logic: Develop a backend service that aggregates all the collected data
into a single, comprehensive prompt.
Example: “Farmer in Kerala reports banana leaf spot; humid weather,
recent rain—give pesticide and organic control in Malayalam.”

Methodology
Stage 3: Core AI Engine (Reasoning & Generation)
Objective: Generate accurate, context-aware answers using AI.
Implementation Steps
1 Set Up and Populate the Vector Database
Technology: Implement a vector database like ChromaDB or Pinecone.
Data Ingestion: Convert all relevant agricultural documents into text
chunks and generate vector embeddings for them.
2 Implement the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Flow
Retrieval: When the enriched prompt is received, its vector embedding
is used to search the vector database for the most relevant chunks of
information.
3 Generate the Response
LLM Integration: Send augmented prompt to LLM (e.g., Google
Gemini) to produce simple Malayalam advisory.
4 Calculate a Confidence Score
Logic: Evaluate response reliability using document relevance or LLM
self-assessment.

Methodology
Stage 4: Response Delivery & Escalation Logic
Objective: To deliver high-quality answers to the farmer and seamlessly
route complex queries to human experts.
Implementation Steps
1 Deliver High-Confidence Answers
If the confidence score is above a set threshold (e.g., 80%), the
generated Malayalam response is sent directly to the farmer’s mobile
app and displayed in the chat interface.
2 Develop the Escalation System
Condition: If the confidence score is below the threshold, the
escalation protocol is triggered.
Data Packaging: The system will package the entire query
context—original query (text/voice/image), farmer profile, location,
weather, and the AI’s low-confidence attempted answer—into a single
case file.

Methodology
Stage 4: Response Delivery & Escalation Logic
3 Build the Agricultural Officer Dashboard
Interface: Create a web-based dashboard for registered agricultural
officers.
Functionality: The dashboard will display a queue of escalated cases.
Experts can review all the context, type their expert advice in
Malayalam, and submit it.
4 Route Expert Response
Once an expert submits their response, the system automatically routes
it back to the farmer’s app, notifying them that an expert has answered
their query.

Methodology
Stage 5: Continuous Improvement (The Learning Loop)
Objective: To create a feedback mechanism that allows the system to learn
from both user interactions and expert input, continuously improving its
accuracy and knowledge base.
1 Capture User Feedback
Mechanism: Add simple ”Helpful” and ”Not Helpful” buttons to each
answer displayed in the app.
Data Logging: Log this feedback against the specific query-response
pair for future analysis and model fine-tuning.
2 Integrate Expert Knowledge
Pipeline: Create an automated pipeline where the expert-provided
answers from the escalation dashboard are treated as ”gold-standard”
data.
Process: Convert these question–answer pairs into vector embeddings
and add them to the database.
Fine-Tuning: Periodically, this high-quality dataset will be used to
fine-tune the LLM, improving its reasoning and generation capabilities
for agricultural topics.
